# Last.fm Web Scraping Script
A python script that fetches data from your last.fm profile and stores it in a text file.

# Usage
In order for the script to work you must set the default display mode for artists and albums to grid, the script's data will be based on the default timeframe you set on your profile.

If using GUI:
Choose the correct info regarding your profile's default display mode, click save data when using for the first time or after changing profile settings then click start to execute the script

If using CLI:
Fill the config.json file with your last.fm username and the number of artists, albums and recent tracks (not top tracks!) listed on your account page by default, then run the script and the data will be written to the Last.fm.txt file
