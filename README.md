# Last.fm Web Scraping Script
A python script that fetches data from your last.fm profile and stores it in a text file.

# Usage
In order for the script to work you must set the default display mode for artists and albums to grid, the script's data will be based on the default timeframe you set on your profile.

Fill the config.json file with your last.fm username and the number of artists, albums and recent tracks (not top tracks!) listed on your account page by default, then run the script and the data will be written to the Last.fm.txt file


a GUI is planned for the future
